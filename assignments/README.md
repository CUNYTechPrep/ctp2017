        * This video course does a great job at comparing ES5 vs ES6 features and syntax.
        * **Note:** The videos sometimes reference _PHP, Laravel, Vue, and other technologies_ which you may not be familiar with. For those parts, focus on how the ES6 syntax works and ignore the details of those specific technologies since we won't be using them.

- Follow the ES6 Tutorial here: https://github.com/CUNYTechPrep/es6-tutorial
