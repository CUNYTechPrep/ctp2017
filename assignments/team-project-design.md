# Team Project Requirements and Design

## Project Technical Requirements

All projects must be full stack applications that include a frontend and a backend developed in JavaScript.

- Must haves:
    + Backend: Node.js, Express.js
        * Use MVC app structure
    + Frontend: React.js and/or Handlebars
        * Must produce HTML/CSS as output
        * Responsive design
        * JSON API is not enough
    + Database: Postgresql or MongoDB
    + Tests: Jest
- The team and mentor will decide if the following are needed:
    + User authentication (passport.js)
    + Use a third party API
        * Google Maps
        * Twilio API's
        * Mail API's
        * Social Media API's

## Getting Started, Design, and Progress Tracking

Many of you are new to developing full stack apps and may not know how to get started. For this reason, every team has been assigned a mentor that will help you with design and provide guidance on how to break up your projects into tasks. The mentor will check in with you weekly, and will help you set your goals, and check up on your progress. They will also tell you when certain portions of your project are due.

In addition to your mentors, during week 6 we provided you:

- [Backend Starter Code](https://github.com/CUNYTechPrep/week-06-projects/tree/master/backend-starter-code) you can use,
- and as a class project, we [designed and began development of a Polling app](https://github.com/CUNYTechPrep/week-06-projects/), 
    + For another example, take a look at design docs a team in last years class developed: https://github.com/FCingel/lift-off-fitness/blob/master/code/docs/Mockups%20%26%20Models.pdf

use these as a guide for your own projects. In particular, take an agile approach to your design and implementation, start out with small core features, and add complexity as you go.
