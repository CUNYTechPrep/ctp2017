# Spring Project Proposal

For the Spring semester of CTP you can propose to build a project using any programming language and technology you wish, and the project areas are open to web, desktop, or systems applications. Your instructors will provide you feedback and will let you know if your project will be approved.

You can work on the project individually or in a team of CTP students. Once your project is approved, a mentor will be assigned, and you will provide weekly check-ins to that mentor. At the end of the Spring semester there will be a Demo night where a select number of projects will be demoed.
